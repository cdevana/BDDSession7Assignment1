1. Why Map-reduce program is needed in Pig Programming? 
	* Map-reduce programming is needed in Pig for the following reasons:
		* Data Factory operations
		* Cleaning and pre-processing data
		* Prototyping and hypothesis testing from the point of view of data analysts
		* Cases where data has to be brought from multiple servers and fed into HDFS
		* Data profiling using sampling
	

2. What are advantages of pig over MapReduce? 
	* Does not require programmers or specifically java programmers to work with complex data
	* Provides high-level language that can be used by data analysts and data scientists	
	
	
3. What is pig engine and what is its importance? 
	* It is a high-level procedural language for querying large semistructred datasets using Hadoop and the MapReduce Platform.
	* It is important because it simplifies the use of Hadoop by allowing SQL-like queries to a distributed dataset.

4. What are the modes of Pig execution? 
	* MapReduce/Hadoop Mode - Pig job runs as a series of MapReduce jobs picking the input and output paths from HDFS.
	* Local Mode - Pig job runs as a single JVM picking local unix path for execution.
	

5. What is grunt shell in Pig? 
	* Interactive shell for execution pig commands.
	* It is used when script file is not provided.
	* It can execute scripts from Grunt via run or exec commands.
	

6. What are the features of Pig Latin language? 
	* Simple syntax
	* Queries are converted to map and reduce jobs without a java programmer intervention
	

7. Is Pig latin commands case sensitive? 
	* The following are case senstivie in pig:
		* Names of relations and fields
		* Pig Latin functions
		* NAmes of parameters
	* Pig Latin keywords are case insensitive.
	

8. What is a data flow language? 
	* Language where data starts out in one format and ends up being delivered to the client in a completely different format.
